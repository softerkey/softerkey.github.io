<h2 id="magic-dps"><strong>Magic DPS</strong></h2>
<h3 id="aisha">Aisha</h3>
<ul>
<li>Primarily focused on single target but has some AoE. She works in almost any content and is best in fights like WB1 and GC1 but is greatly outclassed in all content. S2 is channeled and is the majority of her damage so cc immunity is very useful to have on her (also it targets the wrong enemy in WB3 and wizard labyrinth so she is useless in those). S3 lowers mdef so it should be used before s2 against most enemies. The S3 dark perk combined with Aselica's s3 makes it possible to burst down certain strong enemies (e.g. Infira on ToC floor 75) very quickly even without high star UW's. Blessing of mana perk, mp/sec on gear, and stars on UT2 can allow use of S2 dark even on auto battle. UT2 is her most useful UT but UT3 is sometimes useful for fights wher AoE is needed and hte amp from UT12 can be useful if you have a stronger damage dealer. </li>

<h3 id="kara">Kara</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has two modes, siege mode (single target dps, buffs her attack), anti personnel mode (aoe cc, buffs her defense). In some situations she benefits greatly from being manually controlled. Good for PvE and PvP because of the damage of siege and the stun of anti personnel. She is immune to CC in anti Personnel mode. She typically needs a mana battery like Laias when in siege mode because she doesn't get mp/atk while channeling to be in that mode, and she is very squishy in that mode so she benefits from heroes who buff her defensive stats. In auto mode she usually goes into siege mode pretty quickly so she can auto things that do low damage or that are focused on single target damage. If you want to auto her anti personnel mode, you will need to macro or just play manually.</li>

<h3 id="aselica">Aselica</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has a reputation as a whale only hero due to her magic amp coming primarily from her UW awakening but has a lot of utility outside of that. S3 massively increases p def for a short duration protecting the team from physical burst damage that might otherwise 1 shot them such as the slam from wb1. S3 also gives flat mdef reduction which combined with %mdef reduction from other sources allows strong enemies to be bursted down very quickly. She also helps protect the team with attack rate reduction and decent cc from frequent short stuns and blinds. Highly recommended to pick up for most magic teams after you have your first tank built up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jane">Jane</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very good starting tank focused on increasing team damage. Provides 50% magic amp between s1 light perk and s2. Her s3 heals her based on damage dealt and makes her immune to cc but most importantly with ut3 equipped it gives up to 50% mdef reduction. The healing from s3 can allow her to tank many labyrinths without a healer giving you more freedom to bring your main damage dealer. She can also be built as an aoe damage dealer with s2 light. Does very little to reduce damage taken by the party compared to other knights, only having attack reduction based on her uw awakening.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="morrah">Morrah</h3>
<ul>
<li>A useful but somewhat niche tank that increases mdef and mblock, not recommended for starting out. She can be built with full dps gear and does better damage than most other knights but don't expect her to be your main damage dealer. Her own damage and many of the benefits she provides (magic amp, attack reduction, heal rate reduction) are based on building up flame stacks, it takes time to build them so she isn't very useful in fights that don't give time to do that. She is most useful against the gc boss Tyrfas which she can tank in full dps gear. She can provide 100% heal rate reduction by herself so she is also useful against bosses that heal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neraxis">Neraxis</h3>
<ul>
<li>General purpose tank useful for any content and is great for starting out. Does a bit of almost everything including magic amp, %mdef reduction, party attack/defense increase, attack reduction, slows, and stuns. UT2 gives him a dispel for even more utility and also increases his party defense boost. UT3 is good for enemies with cc bars as it massively increases his cc damage. Somewhat mana hungry so make sure to get some mp/attack and maybe attack speed.</li>

<h3 id="selene">Selene</h3>
<ul>
<li>The best "do it all" physical DPS, she is good in many areas like WB2 and GC2 and clearing the story chapters. Her third skill is a big AoE nuke, it can be used in burst teams in PvP as well as against mobs in PvE. UT1 is useless, ut2 is for single target, ut3 is for PvP, UT4 is for general PvE. If her UW is a high *, she needs no attack speed gear lines. </li>

<ul>
<li>Standard tank, makes the team survive better against physical damage. his skill 2 book effect has a 50% attack speed slow which is extremely useful and makes him a very powerful member of any team against enemies that can be attack slowed. It's so good that he's used for dragons even on magical teams.</li>

<li>Her first skill has some very high burst healing, her second skill is a big shield to one ally that slightly heals them as well. Her third skill gives mana to the rest of the team so she often complements mana hungry heroes like Kara in siege mode. Helps the team survive against magical damage because of a magic defense buff from skill 4.</li>
