If you catch one of these events you will probably want to spend almost all of your stamina potions farming the resources as it can speed up progression a ton, saving you countless hours. as a nub I got 1 shot constantly and I thought I was doing something wrong. when I got to a new boss in the story, when I first tried guild raid and lab and WB, etc. for me mostly it was from shit gear (low tier and unawoken) so don't worry cc is great: as a nub you might get 1 shot a lot as mentioned above, but there are many instances where if you manually spam your CC skills you can get a lot farther too much gold: as a nub they gave me a ton of gold, I remember being on day 3 and having 130m, I had no idea what to do with it. you want to save it for trans and upgrading gear. you can burn 100m in one day Now you can proceed to the advanced guide. \u00b6","title":"Noob Quickstart"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-soft-guide","text":"If you're lazy, read the cheatsheet/reminders under construction","title":"Welcome to the Soft Guide"},{"location":"#the-cheat-sheet","text":"You want to play some KING'S RAID and you are too American to read?

Magic DPS \u00b6 Aisha \u00b6 Primarily focused on single target but has some AoE. She works in almost any content and is best in fights like WB1 and GC1 but is greatly outclassed in all content. S2 is channeled and is the majority of her damage so cc immunity is very useful to have on her (also it targets the wrong enemy in WB3 and wizard labyrinth so she is useless in those). S3 lowers mdef so it should be used before s2 against most enemies. The S3 dark perk combined with Aselica's s3 makes it possible to burst down certain strong enemies (e.g. Infira on ToC floor 75) very quickly even without high star UW's. Blessing of mana perk, mp/sec on gear, and stars on UT2 can allow use of S2 dark even on auto battle. UT2 is her most useful UT but UT3 is sometimes useful for fights wher AoE is needed and hte amp from UT12 can be useful if you have a stronger damage dealer. Artemia \u00b6 Epis \u00b6 Ezekiel \u00b6 Kara \u00b6 Has two modes, siege mode (single target dps, buffs her attack), anti personnel mode (aoe cc, buffs her defense). In some situations she benefits greatly from being manually controlled. Good for PvE and PvP because of the damage of siege and the stun of anti personnel. She is immune to CC in anti Personnel mode. She typically needs a mana battery like Laias when in siege mode because she doesn't get mp/atk while channeling to be in that mode, and she is very squishy in that mode so she benefits from heroes who buff her defensive stats. In auto mode she usually goes into siege mode pretty quickly so she can auto things that do low damage or that are focused on single target damage. If you want to auto her anti personnel mode, you will need to macro or play manually. Lewisia \u00b6 Mirianne \u00b6 Shamilla \u00b6 Laudia \u00b6 Luna \u00b6 Seria \u00b6 AoE magic damage and defense ignore specialist. Probably the only hero who can get defense ignore on all three of her skills. For general damage output you usually just want to spam S1>S1 for its high damage, low cost and quick animation. S2 is used to dash through enemy lines and then attack the enemy back line also against a pack of enemies S2 will build up a lot of stacks on her S4. S3 is usually used as your big AoE or finisher move as you usually want to be high on S4 stacks before it's used. Seria's T5D means she always hits with a critial for all attacks and skills, meaning you can skip crit lines and focus on a.spd/atk/c.dmg and with defense ignore for skills you can also skip on penetration in most cases. S1's AoE is very small so you need enemis clustered. S2's AoE is only the area she dashes through, and S3's AoE is a massive circle around her. UT1 for PvE, UT3 for PvP Magic Sub DPS \u00b6 Maria \u00b6 a powerful crowd control user. S1 is a knock back that hits several times, the enemies generally cannot counter attack until they've been hit by all 3 attacks of the skill. S2 is a long duration lock-down that hits the 2 closest enemies disabling them for 6 seconds(7.5 with perk) and her S3 is why she's feared often in the arena. Arena of Darkness (S3) is a wide area AoE that pulls enemies into a nice compact area deals and stuns them for 3 seconds on the final hit. A clustered pack of enemies is prime target for many aoe damage dealers both in pve and pvp. Couple her skills with her T5D where she can reset her cooldowns from critical hits (auto attacks and skill use and per hit) it's possible thru clever timing to keep multiple enemies in CC hell perpetually. So long as they don't have a stun meter. UT4 is her best pve damage treasure, and you can use either UT1 or UT3 for pvp depending on your needs. Lorraine \u00b6 Viska \u00b6 Magic Tanks \u00b6 Aselica \u00b6 Has a reputation as a whale only hero due to her magic amp coming primarily from her UW awakening but has a lot of utility outside of that. S3 massively increases p def for a short duration protecting the team from physical burst damage that might otherwise 1 shot them such as the slam from wb1. S3 also gives flat mdef reduction which combined with %mdef reduction from other sources allows strong enemies to be bursted down very quickly. She also helps protect the team with attack rate reduction and decent cc from frequent short stuns and blinds. Highly recommended to pick up for most magic teams after you have your first tank built up. Jane \u00b6 Very good starting tank focused on increasing team damage. Provides 50% magic amp between s1 light perk and s2. Her s3 heals her based on damage dealt and makes her immune to cc but most importantly with ut3 equipped it gives up to 50% mdef reduction. The healing from s3 can allow her to tank many labyrinths without a healer giving you more freedom to bring your main damage dealer. She can also be built as an aoe damage dealer with s2 light. Does very little to reduce damage taken by the party compared to other knights, only having attack reduction based on her uw awakening. Morrah \u00b6 A useful but somewhat niche tank that increases mdef and mblock, not recommended for starting out. She can be built with full dps gear and does better damage than most other knights but don't expect her to be your main damage dealer. Her own damage and many of the benefits she provides (magic amp, attack reduction, heal rate reduction) are based on building up flame stacks, it takes time to build them so she isn't very useful in fights that don't give time to do that. She is most useful against the gc boss Tyrfas which she can tank in full dps gear. She can provide 100% heal rate reduction by herself so she is also useful against bosses that heal. Neraxis \u00b6 General purpose tank useful for any content and is great for starting out. Does a bit of almost everything including magic amp, %mdef reduction, party attack/defense increase, attack reduction, slows, and stuns. UT2 gives him a dispel for even more utility and also increases his party defense boost. UT3 is good for enemies with cc bars as it massively increases his cc damage. Somewhat mana hungry so make sure to get some mp/attack and maybe attack speed. Sonia \u00b6 Physical DPS \u00b6 Lilia \u00b6 Alternate \"do it all\" physical DPS. While Selene has superior DPS to many bosses due to her DEF ignore, Lilia is much stronger in PvP, comfortably Challenger tier. Her S1 and S3 have random targeting with a small AoE which allows her to hit backline mobs or AoE if clumped up. Her S2 can also be perked to give to another DPS ally, allowing her to function as a buffer that gives ATK, DEF, and the rare Mana Recovery. She needs specific gear lines as she functions on Mana Recovery Rate and cannot use Mana per Attack, a new player needs to use his T7 Gear Selector tickets to gear her quickly. Needs 5 Mana Recovery lines minimum and S3 is a channel so CC immunity supports are desirable. Be wary of Lilia stealing buffs due to her kit giving herself loads of ATK. T5 needed. UT1 or UT2 as a SUB DPS, UT1 or UT3 as a MAIN DPS. Synergies: Priscilla (CDMG buff and UT2 CDR), Lavril (CDMG buff) Yanne \u00b6 Selene \u00b6 The best \"do it all\" physical DPS, she is good in many areas like WB2 and GC2 and clearing the story chapters. Her third skill is a big AoE nuke, it can be used in burst teams in PvP as well as against mobs in PvE. UT1 is useless, ut2 is for single target, ut3 is for PvP, UT4 is for general PvE. If her UW is a high *, she needs no attack speed gear lines. Erze \u00b6 Physical sub DPS \u00b6 Miruru \u00b6 Naila \u00b6 Physical Tanks \u00b6 Clause \u00b6 Standard tank, makes the team survive better against physical damage. his skill 2 book effect has a 50% attack speed slow which is extremely useful and makes him a very powerful member of any team against enemies that can be attack slowed. It's so good that he's used for dragons even on magical teams. Loman \u00b6 Phillop \u00b6 Glenwys \u00b6 Priests \u00b6 most priests work for both types unless stated otherwise so I'm combining the phys/mag section \u00b6 Baudouin \u00b6 Cassandra \u00b6 Frey \u00b6 The Priest of the big team wide shield. Frey isn't known for her healing power. She's actually a strong burst healer, but only for one target (2 with perks) where often you need multiple party members healed. However if your party doesn't take damage then they don't need healing and that's where Frey's S2 shines thru. Offering a big party wide HP buffer, able to reach over a million and even several million HP with enough investment you can mitigate massive attacks and it provided CC immunity while the shield is up. A well invested Frey can provide a 10+ million HP shield to the whole party (when most none tanks only have 3-5mil HP). Her S3 is a simple blind skill which helps to mitigate damage from causing enemies to miss some attacks, but it also drains a large amount of stun meter on bosses helping to procure a knock down. just watch out for enemies that dispel her shield cause then she and your team will be defenseless. UT2 is her perferred UT in almost all scenarios. Juno \u00b6 Laias \u00b6 Her first skill has some very high burst healing, her second skill is a big shield to one ally that slightly heals them as well as gives them a decent attack buff. Her third skill gives mana to the rest of the team so she often complements mana hungry heroes like Kara in siege mode. Helps the team survive against magical damage because of a magic defense buff from skill 4. Lavril \u00b6 Leo \u00b6 PvP shota Lucias \u00b6 May \u00b6 Mediana \u00b6 One of two PvE physical healers. Great burst healing and damage amp. her first skill makes all allies immune to the next hit of damage, and her second skill is a continuous heal that does decent damage for a priest but has a long cooldown so use it wisely. her third skill is a major DPS buff to the main dps hero on your team. You want to build her with lots of attack % lines to improve her third skill buff. UT1 is best for general PvE. Rephy \u00b6 Shea \u00b6 heavily suggested to have at least 4* UW Advanced Gearing \u00b6 coming soon Advanced PvP \u00b6 coming soon Guild Raid \u00b6 as a member of soft I don't know what guild raid is so someone from a different guild will have to write this section.

She works in almost any content and is best in fights like WB1 and GC1 but is greatly outclassed in all content. S2 is channeled and is the majority of her damage so cc immunity is very useful to have on her (also it targets the wrong enemy in WB3 and wizard labyrinth so she is useless in those). S3 lowers mdef so it should be used before s2 against most enemies. The S3 dark perk combined with Aselica's s3 makes it possible to burst down certain strong enemies (e.g. Infira on ToC floor 75) very quickly even without high star UW's. Blessing of mana perk, mp/sec on gear, and stars on UT2 can allow use of S2 dark even on auto battle.

In some situations she benefits greatly from being manually controlled. Good for PvE and PvP because of the damage of siege and the stun of anti personnel. She is immune to CC in anti Personnel mode. She typically needs a mana battery like Laias when in siege mode because she doesn't get mp/atk while channeling to be in that mode, and she is very squishy in that mode so she benefits from heroes who buff her defensive stats. In auto mode she usually goes into siege mode pretty quickly so she can auto things that do low damage or that are focused on single target damage.

Probably the only hero who can get defense ignore on all three of her skills. For general damage output you usually just want to spam S1>S1 for its high damage, low cost and quick animation. S2 is used to dash through enemy lines and then attack the enemy back line also against a pack of enemies S2 will build up a lot of stacks on her S4. S3 is usually used as your big AoE or finisher move as you usually want to be high on S4 stacks before it's used. Seria's T5D means she always hits with a critial for all attacks and skills, meaning you can skip crit lines and focus on a.spd/atk/c.dmg and with defense ignore for skills you can also skip on penetration in most cases. S1's AoE is very small so you need enemis clustered. S2's AoE is only the area she dashes through, and S3's AoE is a massive circle around her.

S1 is a knock back that hits several times, the enemies generally cannot counter attack until they've been hit by all 3 attacks of the skill. S2 is a long duration lock-down that hits the 2 closest enemies disabling them for 6 seconds(7.5 with perk) and her S3 is why she's feared often in the arena. Arena of Darkness (S3) is a wide area AoE that pulls enemies into a nice compact area deals and stuns them for 3 seconds on the final hit. A clustered pack of enemies is prime target for many aoe damage dealers both in pve and pvp. Couple her skills with her T5D where she can reset her cooldowns from critical hits (auto attacks and skill use and per hit) it's possible thru clever timing to keep multiple enemies in CC hell perpetually. So long as they don't have a stun meter. UT4 is her best pve damage treasure, and you can use either UT1 or UT3 for pvp depending on your needs.","title":"Maria"},{"location":"advanced/#lorraine","text":"","title":"Lorraine"},{"location":"advanced/#viska","text":"","title":"Viska"},{"location":"advanced/#magic-tanks","text":"","title":"Magic Tanks"},{"location":"advanced/#aselica","text":"Has a reputation as a whale only hero due to her magic amp coming primarily from her UW awakening but has a lot of utility outside of that.

S3 also gives flat mdef reduction which combined with %mdef reduction from other sources allows strong enemies to be bursted down very quickly.
